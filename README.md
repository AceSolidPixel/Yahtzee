Create a dice game that uses the Die class that was given in Lecture 5. Create a new class called
Die in a file called ‘Die.java’, add the code from the lecture notes, and then add an equals
method and a less than method that returns true if the implicit parameter is less than the explicit
parameter and false otherwise. In the same project folder, create a second class called Player in a
file called ‘Player.java’
